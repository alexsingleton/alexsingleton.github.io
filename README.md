# Academic Website

The code in this repo generates the academic website and blog for [Alex Singleton](http://www.alex-singleton.com).

This is now hosted on Github pages and is generated by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The old version of the website that was built using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/) template can still be found [here](https://github.com/alexsingleton/website).
