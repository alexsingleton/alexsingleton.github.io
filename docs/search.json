The extent and boundaries of these areas are identified based on the density and connectivity patterns of individual retail units over space, with the areas delineated using H3 polygons.\nA high resolution hexagonal grid is superimposed over spatial clusters of retail points and a network-based algorithm used to identify mutually exclusive tracts. Agglomerations are then pruned and fine-tuned according to a series of heuristic rules.\nOur retail agglomerations represent local commerce areas with shopping amenities and are assigned to a hierarchical classification ranking from the largest Regional Centres, Major Town Centres and Town Centres, down to Small Local Centres and Retail Parks.\n\nFull details can be found in this paper:\nMacdonald, J.

These are not particularly successful as maps, although are aesthetically pleasing!\nWhen the more recent large language models have evolved substantially over the past year has been in their ability to generate code. In this post, I have created the outputs entirely from a single prompt, and present this as it was produced by OpenAI ChatGPT 4o.\nThe prompt:\n\nI want you to generate an entire blog post that provides step by step instructions to create a map of hospital locations in Liverpool City Region using R with code using both the tidyverse and SF.\nI then want you to map hospital accessibility.\nI want the blog post to reference some interesting patterns within the map. The code blocks should be presented as they would in a Quarto document and be executable in R. The code that is created should be entirely self contained, so have no manual files provided by the user.\n\nThis generated the following: (jump to the end for the Section 2)\n\nMapping Hospital Locations and Accessibility in Greater London Using R\nIn this tutorial, we’ll create a map of hospital locations across Greater London and explore hospital accessibility using R.

Each hospital location will have spatial coordinates, allowing us to visualize them on a map.\n\n\nStep 2: Plotting Hospitals on a Map of Greater London\nNow we’ll retrieve boundary data for Greater London, allowing us to create a contextual map to visualize hospital locations within the city.\n\n# Retrieve boundary of Greater London\nlondon_boundary &lt;- opq(bbox = london_bbox) %&gt;%\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"boundary\", value = \"administrative\") %&gt;%\n  osmdata_sf() %&gt;%\n  .$osm_multipolygons %&gt;%\n  filter(name == \"Greater London\")\n\n# Plot the map\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = london_boundary, fill = NA, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf(data = hospitals, color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Hospital Locations in Greater London\",\n       caption = \"Data Source: OpenStreetMap\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map gives an initial visual distribution of hospitals across Greater London, highlighting the urban core with clusters of healthcare facilities.\n\n\nStep 3: Calculating Accessibility to Hospitals\nTo measure accessibility, we’ll calculate the Euclidean distance between any given point within Greater London and the nearest hospital. Let’s generate a grid over Greater London to act as hypothetical locations where people might live or work, and calculate the distances to the closest hospital.\n\n# Define a grid over Greater London\ngrid &lt;- st_make_grid(london_boundary, cellsize = 0.01, square = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  filter(st_intersects(., london_boundary, sparse = FALSE))\n\n# Calculate distance from each grid cell to the nearest hospital\ngrid$nearest_hospital_dist &lt;- st_distance(grid, hospitals) %&gt;%\n  apply(1, min) #%&gt;%  units::set_units(\"km\") \n\n\n# Plot distance to nearest hospital\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = london_boundary, fill = NA, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf(data = grid, aes(fill = nearest_hospital_dist), color = NA) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Distance to Nearest Hospital (km)\") +\n  labs(title = \"Hospital Accessibility in Greater London\",\n       caption = \"Data Source: OpenStreetMap\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis accessibility map reveals which areas are more isolated in terms of hospital access. Outer London areas, particularly in the southern and eastern boroughs, may show larger distances to the nearest hospital, highlighting areas where healthcare access might be more limited.\n\n\nStep 4: Observing Patterns and Conclusions\nFrom the generated maps, some patterns emerge:\n\nHospital Clustering: Hospitals tend to cluster around central London, particularly near well-developed areas like Westminster, Southwark, and Camden. This reflects the concentration of population and infrastructure.\nAccessibility Gaps: Certain boroughs in the outer edges of Greater London, such as Bromley and Havering, display limited hospital accessibility. This suggests potential areas for future healthcare infrastructure improvements, especially in regions with lower density but substantial residential areas.\nUrban Core Accessibility: The central parts of London generally have excellent access, with distances to the nearest hospital typically falling below 2 km. This is ideal for urgent care accessibility and reflects the historic distribution of healthcare facilities\n\n\n\nConclusion\nBy using R, tidyverse, and sf, we’ve created an insightful geographic analysis of hospital locations and accessibility within Greater London. Mapping accessibility gaps provides valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers to target underserved areas and improve healthcare distribution.\nThis workflow is entirely reproducible using the osmdata package for real-time data extraction from OpenStreetMap, making it adaptable for analyses in other cities or regions.\n\n\n\nCritique\nOverall the results are quite impressive and the single shot prompt made a number of reasonable maps, and conducted some fairly “creative” spatial analysis. In general, the ability to generate code is pretty sophisticated in the current generation of large language models as a result of the large corpus of code training data.\nA few critical thoughts:\n\nOntology matters - in this instance “London” is interpreted as Greater London. To generate any results, this also relied on this definition being understood by the getbb function.\nThere is a reliance on OSM data being queried by bounding box. As such, some hospitals falling outside of “London” are also found, and no attempt is made to subset the found locations geographically.\nI had to make one tiny change to the code to correct an issue with units. It is also worth noting that the map has a legend key in KM not M.\nIt is difficult to say whether the observations that are made are related to the map or what might generally be logical in the context of the question asked. The statements about specific areas in London are interesting - as it is unclear based on the representation that these locations would be observable in any way.\n\nThe extent to which large language models posses or mimic (I will leave that one for now!) spatial literacy is an active research topic. There is significant complexity to spatial cognition, and it is clear our current generation of models have room for improvement in this area. As a not particularly sophisticated or scientific test, I fed the final map image presented back into GPT 4o and asked:\n\nIn a paragraph interpret the spatial / geographical patterns that are shown in this map for a blog post\n\nThis map of hospital accessibility in Greater London reveals a distinctive spatial pattern, where central areas exhibit higher accessibility to healthcare facilities compared to the outer regions. The darker, purple-shaded zones, concentrated around the city’s core, indicate shorter distances to the nearest hospital, highlighting Greater London’s centrality in healthcare infrastructure. In contrast, as we move outward toward suburban and peripheral areas, the colors shift to green and yellow, signifying longer distances and thus reduced accessibility. This pattern underscores a familiar urban-rural divide in healthcare availability, where city centers often benefit from a higher density of services, while outer regions experience fewer options and increased travel times for urgent care. This spatial disparity poses challenges, particularly for residents in more remote zones, emphasizing the need for targeted health infrastructure improvements to bridge the accessibility gap across Greater London.\nThink we will leave this one here…! My general takeaway is AI is excellent help for coding; but better check those interpretations! Human spatial literacy still has some salience yet!\nFinal final…. I fed the generated interpretation back into GPT 4o and asked for an image…. well it looks pretty at least!"

    "text": "While in recent years the burgeoning Higher Education (HE) sector has been set an agenda of widening participation, few HE institutions have strategies in place for reaching the full range of potential students most likely to benefit from (and successfully complete) their current subject and course offerings. Universities and colleges are often unsystematic in the ways in which they identify schools and colleges for outreach and widening participation initiatives, and sometimes uncoordinated in how they present the full institutional profile of subjects of study in these activities. Using innovative methodology, this book sets out some relevant aspects of the changing HE policy-setting arena and presents a systematic framework for broadening participation and extending access in an era of variable fees. In particular, the book illustrates how HE data and publicly available sources might enable institutions to move from piecemeal analysis of their intake to institution-wide strategic and geographical market area analysis for existing and potential subject and course offerings.\n\nRoutledge Website"

    "text": "Geocomputation is the use of software and computing power to solve complex spatial problems. It is gaining increasing importance in the era of the 'big data' revolution, of 'smart cities', of crowdsourced data, and of associated applications for viewing and managing data geographically - like Google Maps. This student focused book:\n\nProvides a selection of practical examples of geocomputational techniques and 'hot topics' written by world leading practitioners.\nIntegrates supporting materials in each chapter, such as code and data, enabling readers to work through the examples themselves.\n\nChapters provide highly applied and practical discussions of:\n\nVisualisation and exploratory spatial data analysis\nSpace time modelling\nSpatial algorithms\nSpatial regression and statistics\nEnabling interactions through the use of neogeography\n\nAll chapters are uniform in design and each includes an introduction, case studies, conclusions - drawing together the generalities of the introduction and specific findings from the case study application – and guidance for further reading.\nThis accessible text has been specifically designed for those readers who are new to Geocomputation as an area of research, showing how complex real-world problems can be solved through the integration of technology, data, and geocomputational methods. This is the applied primer for Geocomputation in the social sciences.\n\nSage Website\nSupporting Materials"

    "text": "Day 2: Lines\nThis map was created as part of a study where we were looking at the location and content of outdoor advertisements.We were particularly interested in whether vulnerable populations in deprived areas had greater exposure to fast food, gambling and alcohol advertisements. To address this problem we develop a deep learning workflow to automatically extract and classify unhealthy advertisements from street-level images that we collected using a 360 degree camera. We found evidence of social inequalities with a larger proportion of food advertisements located within deprived areas and those frequented by students.\nThe map depicts the path we took collecting datawith the colour coded segments indicating lower-layer super output areas (LSOAs) boundaries.\n\nFull details can be found in this paper:\nPalmer, G., Green, M., Boyland, E., Vasconcelos, Y.

It is not of an individual journey, but the outcomes of multiple journeys. I developed an estimation technique to model CO2 emissions linked with the journey to school that integrated both transport network-level routing and geographically disaggregate vehicle emissions data.\nEmissions were shown to increase with school year, with larger step changes between educational stages reflecting the different geography of school locations. Furthermore, where secondary school entry policies were selective or based on a religious domination, average emissions were typically higher than in non-selective schools.\n\nFull details can be found in this paper:\nSingleton, A.

    "text": "Almost ten years ago I decided to map everything in the 2011 Census… this was really a test for my developing R skills, but also to scratch an itch that I had since starting to code more seriously.\n\n\nAlthough I am not even sure that these are online anymore (or at least I can’t find them!!), the project was quite successful (the Guardian picked it up)- in a nutshell, I created a PDF map for every local authority; mapping all of the 2011 Census Key Statistics for England and Wales.\nThis was in a pre-github era for me, so the code (which may or may not work) can be found here - it is very messy, and uses LaTex to render each PDF.\nThere is always horror when looking back at your own code, which reflects the progress that you have made at coding, but also the rapidly evolving nature of languages like R. Since my 2011 work there have been huge developments in both mapping and publishing packages, making much of what was done before either redundant, simpler or more easy to automate.\n\n\n\nThe original project was organised into consolidated PDF Mapbooks containing all the maps for each local authority. These files were reasonably large, and I was never sure that it was the most effective dissemination mechanism. I liked the PDF format for the maps as this enabled them to store the images as vectors: so you don’t need to worry about image resolution etc. They also tended to be more compact in size relative to rasters (png, jpg etc).\nI have been particularly enthusiastic about Quarto the past couple of years which is a publishing framework that is used to create this website / blog, but can also be used for lots of other things like reports and presentations. While making this website, I had an idea that the components of the Quarto framework could also be adapted to create an updated census mapping project …. which is how we ended up here!\n\n\n\nI blogged here about processing the 2021 England and Wales census data for output areas; specifically: creating new column names and a metadata table so that they could be used programmatically without lots of cleaning. The code that creates the local authority web pages described here use these data.\nThe code used in this project can be found over on Githubbut in simple terms:\n\nGenerates a skeleton website using Quarto\nRemoves unwanted content and builds a new directory structure organized around regions and local authority codes\nPopulates local authority folders with census data table extracts as CSVs\nProduces new quarto (.qmd) pages with code that will (when rendered):\n\nProduce a directory structure / searchable content\nProduce tables and maps for the local authority pages\n\nWhen the Quarto website is rendered, all of the files created above have the R code within them run, and this generates an HTML website in a format that can be deployed on github.\n\nI have tried to be as detailed as possible in the comments associated with the R code generating the above, so I would hope that this would be easy to replicate if you wanted to create something similar for another project. Also, if you don’t like the specific maps (or colours etc), then there is code for each local authority to make an alternative version.\n\n\n\nR is such a versatile language; and for the most part, if you can imagine it: it can be done. For a project like this, you don’t even need an especially fancy computer to run the code.\nThe machine used for this project is my HP ZBook Firefly 14 inch G8, which has 32 gig memory and an i7 CPU (2.8 Ghz; 4 cores). The code ran start to finish in 16 hours; generating 99,674 maps!\nA conservative estimate of the time it would take to create a map manually might be 5 mins; and if so, to generate the same amount of maps, this would equate to 498,370 minutes or 8,306 hours. This is 346 days if you were working a 24 hour shift! If we look at this more reasonably, at £15.00 / hour and based on a 37.5 hour working week (~£29k / year salary); making all of these maps would take 221 weeks or around 4.2 years; costing (assuming no pay rise!) about £122k!

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nSince moving to Windows 11 wholesale I have done all of my R development using a Docker running an Rstudio Server instance. This post aims to illustrate the steps needed to set this up on your own machine.\n\n\nInstall WSL 2\nFrom the start menu right click PowerShell “Run as Administrator”. Type into the terminal that opens:\nwsl --install\nWait for the installation to complete; which also installs Ubuntu by default.\n\n\nSetup Docker\nDownload Docker Desktop for Windows. There is a prominent button on this linked page.\nWhen this has downloaded, double click to open and run the “Docker Desktop Installer.exe” file which should be found in your default web browser install location.\nThis will prompt you with a “Configuration” pop up. Make sure the option for “Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V (recommended)” is selected and click the “Ok” button. This will then install Docker.\nWhen this has completed, close the dialog box and restart Windows.\n\n\nPost Setup\nAfter the reboot, you will get a terminal popup that completes the Ubuntu install. This will ask you for a username. Use something memorable and type into the prompt in all lower case letters, then press enter. You will then be asked to setup a password for the installation too; choose something you will remember, type into the prompt and press enter. You can close the Ubuntu terminal window.\nYou should also see a Docker Desktop icon your Desktop or Start Menu. If you double click this and accept the T&C on the popup prompt, it will run Docker Desktop. This is the interface where you can see what images you have downloaded, and what containers you currently have setup, along with their current status .. ie if they are running or not. This will all be empty at the minute as you have not yet downloaded an image or started a container.\n\n\nSetup a Container for Rstudio\nThe next step is to download a docker image, which contains R, Rstudio and lots of useful packages. Before we do this, we will create a folder which you can use for your R projects - you can change this, but as an example we will create a new folder called “r_projects” in the root of your C: drive (e.g. “C:_projects”). You will be able to find the C: drive using the “File Explorer” from the start menu.\nNext, we will now run a Docker command that will:\n\nSetup a new instance called Test_R (you can change this name to whatever your project is).\nSetup a password for Rstudio - this is “secret”, but can be anything you like.\nAutomatically downloads an image - in this case we will use rocker/geospatial.\n\nopen PowerShell again from the start menu and run the following command:\ndocker run -e ROOT=true --name Test_R -v C:\\r_projects:/home/ -e PASSWORD=secret -p 8787:8787 rocker/geospatial\nYou might get a notification about Windows Defender Firewall - you will need to agree to this for Docker to run.\n\n\nRun Rstudio\nIn the Docker Desktop Application, under “Containers” you will now see that your “Test_R” container is running. This also lists the image that it is using as “rocker/geospatial”. You can have multiple containers running from the same image; so you might want to create one for each new project; although you typically only run one at a time. On the far right hand side you will also see a stop button which can be used to stop the container running.\nThere is also a square button with an arrow on it; which can be used to open Rstudio. Alternatively, you can type the following URL in a web browser: http://localhost:8787/.\nThis will open the Rstudio interface and ask for a username and password. These will be “rstudio” and whatever password you specified. As written above this was “secret”. You will then have a full Rstudio instance running in the web browser!"

This introduced a concept of “generalized activity spaces” to bridge a gap in understanding geographic context through both spatial activity and demographic attributes. Our model aimed to move beyond traditional microscale “space-time paths,” which focus on individual movements, to a broader, more inclusive framework that considers demographic and socioeconomic factors shaping individuals’ activity spaces.\nIn this we standardised individuals’ activity paths into a generalized format using a polar coordinate system centered on each participant’s home, with directional data aligned to a common reference point.\n\nBy translating each trip into this standardized coordinate system, this enabled us to compare activity patterns across different geographic and demographic groups without distortions introduced by specific local configurations of the built environment.\nFindings highlighted that while location alone is not a comprehensive descriptor, a combination of residential location and demographics can yield generalised insights into how individuals use space.\nFull details can be found in this paper:\nSpielman, S. E., & Singleton, A. D. (2022). A Generalized Model of Activity Space. Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 1–18. https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2022.2077165\nDownload the paper here."

Although I never saw him, the Duke of Northumberland’s pipe player also lived over the road (who I heard a lot).\nThe woods where we used to play, but are now built on; and top left, the Monkey Puzzle tree where when we were very small were taken on “bike rides” to - in fact it was on a 1950s tricycle, and also was pulled up there by rope attached to my dads bike as it was a hill (he is very nice!).\nThe “Green Hill” which my brother and I used to ride bikes down, and the large tree where I rode a bike into opposite my house. I also got knocked off a bike by a dog here too. It was generally an unlucky area for bikes (nothing to do with my coordination).\n\nBased on the above, which I came up with while waiting for my kids to finish some sports, I was intrigued if this is in any way true to life, which you can have a look at on OpenStreetMap.\n\nSome things of note - the “Green Hill” is very small:\n\n\nThe big tree I rode a bike into isn’t really very big and I remembered a wide path as a road.\n\n\nAnd this was my house, which is about in the correct location on my map. When we lived there the front garden only had a rockery and a lawn, and was also surrounded by large trees. The StreetView images are from 2009, so things may well have changed now. I do note that the new owner appears to have an Aston Martin, which says a lot about the changing demographics of Alnwick since the 1980s! By contrast we had a 100k mile Ford Cortina.\n\n\nSomething else that I never really thought about as a child, but the other thing about this street is the really weird name! Oakey Balks… I would love to know the origins of this!"

    "text": "Day 14: A World Map\nMy own research tends to not be at the global scale, however, I am fortunate to supervise some clever PhD students who have led work that I have co-authored. This map was created by Ruth Neville and shows the relationship between the number of accepted undergraduate university applications (log) from an origin country relative to its human development level (2009–2019). The map is shaded using a bivariate colour scheme.\n\nThe paper shows that the number of international students coming to the UK is linked to how developed their home countries are, but this relationship isn’t straightforward. The data shows that student numbers increase with the development level, but not linearly. Most students come from countries with mid to high levels of development (around 0.7 to 0.9 on the human development index). Interestingly, there’s a slowdown in student numbers from countries at the higher end of medium development, which could mean fewer students applying or being able to come from these emerging markets.\nThe map shows that most students come from highly developed countries like the USA, France, Germany, and Poland, as well as China, which has a high development level. India, at a medium development level, also sends many students, and even Nigeria, with a lower development level, showed relatively high student flows. It suggests that while the UK mostly attracts students from well-developed countries, there are exceptions where countries with different development levels send more students than expecte\nFull details can be found in this paper:\nNeville, R., Rowe, F., & Singleton, A.

    "text": "Day 15: My Data\nOne of the main reasons that I got interested in Geography was because my dad had experienced a lot of it in his life and consequently told us about it. He had been a Geologist for the British Antarctic Survey and had done some pretty wild adventuring as part of his job and more generally in the 1970s. This included Antartcia , the Himalayas and the Andes. I have never been to any of these places, potentially as a result of the volume of slide shows that I have seen.\nThis was my dad in Antarctica with his lead dog called Sue who he trained up from a puppy. This generation of explorers used dogs extensively for transportation - off topic, but there is a really interesting book on this.\n\nThis is another one of him looking more adventurous on his sledge. The pipe he is holding was purely an aesthetic choice to make him look more adventurous apparently.\n\nMy dad has a huge numbers of Antarctic stories, but the one that I really like as a Geographer is that he has a mountain named after him. Well the top of a mountain peeking out of the snow, as formally it is a Nunatak. He was the first person to go there and then also map it - this is an extract of the full map:\n\nThere is more about Singleton Nunatak on its Wikipedia page.\nThis map extract comes from the full publication, which can be downloaded in full from the NERC archive:\nSingleton, D.G.. 1980 The geology of the central Black Coast, Palmer Land. Cambridge, British Antarctic Survey, 50pp. (British Antarctic Survey Scientific Reports, 102)."

In this a set of Output Areas where the non populated built up areas had been extracted was used as a basemap over extruded building polygons.
