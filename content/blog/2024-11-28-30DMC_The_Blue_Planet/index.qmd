# Day 28: The Blue Planet

Now up to version 4, ‘[Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/access-healthy-assets-hazards-ahah)' (AHAH) is an index of neighborhood-level access to various health-related assets and hazards. One of the inputs includes a measure of **Bluespace** given how access to natural environments is known to influence physical and mental wellbeing.

You can view and interactive version of the map [here](https://mapmaker.cdrc.ac.uk/#/access-healthy-assets-hazards?d=11110000&m=ah4blue_pct&lon=-1.9162&lat=52.511&zoom=9.93).
