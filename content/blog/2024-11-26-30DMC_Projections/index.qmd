# Day 26: Map Projections

An inherent challenge when creating a map is how we represent the earth as a three-dimensional sphere as a two-dimensional surface. For today's map challenge, I have created as short tutorial that explores a series of different map projections.

## Setup Packages

First, we can load the required packages and extract some geographic data:

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
```


```{r}
# Load world map data using rnaturalearth package
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
```

## The Mercator Projection

Mercator is a very widely used map projection, and is notably used by Google Maps for its web mapping platform. A world map in a Mercator projection looks is shown below. Notice that there is a quite extreme size distortion near the poles.

``` {r}
ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) +
  theme_minimal() 
```
The Mercator projection is a [conformal projection] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map_projection) meaning that it is angle-preserving. This makes it very useful for navigation (see this article about[Rhumb Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhumb_line)). As noted above, it does have quite severe distortion of areas that are near the poles. Visually, Greenland is represented as being almost as large as Africa (Africa is actually about [14 times larger](https://mortenjonassen.dk/maps/greenland-vs-africa-size-comparison!)

## The Equal Earth Projection

The [Equal Earth projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Earth_projection) wascreated in 2018 and aimed to maintain relative size relationships while being visually pleasing.

``` {r}
ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf() +
   coord_sf(crs = 8857)  +
  theme_minimal() 
```
The Equal Earth projection maintains accurate size relationships between landmasses, featuring curved parallels and meridians while keeping distortion minimal near the equator.

## Comparing Area Distortion

The following function and map aim to visualize relative area distortion for Mertcator.

``` {r}
calculate_distortion <- function(world, projection) {
  # Project the data
  projected <- st_transform(world, projection)
  
  # Calculate areas
  true_areas <- st_area(st_transform(world, "+proj=eck4"))  # Using Eckert IV as reference
  projected_areas <- st_area(projected)
  
  # Calculate distortion ratio
  distortion <- as.numeric(projected_areas / true_areas)
  
  return(distortion)
}

# Add distortion to our world data for Mercator
mercator_crs <- "+proj=merc"
world <- world %>%
  mutate(mercator_distortion = calculate_distortion(., mercator_crs))

# Create distortion visualization
ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = mercator_distortion)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Area Distortion Ratio)", 
                       trans = "log",
                       labels = scales::number_format()) +
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) +
  theme_minimal() 

```

This approach is fairly effective, but one of the best visual tools I've come across for exploring map projections is [The True Size Of](https://www.thetruesize.com/). For a full visual explanation of the issues with traditional maps, you can find a great write-up [here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/problem-with-our-maps/).
