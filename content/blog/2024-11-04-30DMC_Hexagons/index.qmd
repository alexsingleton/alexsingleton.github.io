# Day 4: Hexagons

Todays [map](https://mapmaker.cdrc.ac.uk/#/retail-centres?d=11110000&m=classif_intid&lon=-2.9495&lat=53.3897&zoom=12.38) is of our town centre and high-street definitions. The extent and boundaries of these areas are identified based on the density and connectivity patterns of individual retail units over space, with the areas delineated using [H3 polygons](https://h3geo.org/).

A high resolution hexagonal grid is superimposed over spatial clusters of retail points and a network-based algorithm used to identify mutually exclusive tracts. Agglomerations are then pruned and fine-tuned according to a series of heuristic rules.

Our retail agglomerations represent local commerce areas with shopping amenities and are assigned to a hierarchical classification ranking from the largest Regional Centres, Major Town Centres and Town Centres, down to Small Local Centres and Retail Parks.
