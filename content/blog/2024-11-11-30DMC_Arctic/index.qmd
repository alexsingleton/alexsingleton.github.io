# Day 11: Arctic

This map is a fairly random one, as I have never mapped the Arctic before so had limited idea of what data were available. That said, with a bit of Google searching and the help of the [ESRI Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/), I put together this interactive map showing [Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Search_and_Rescue_Agreement) zones which were provided by [NGA](https://arctic-nga.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0e38920f92774356b20cf29d48e7099f_0/explore), and median ice sheet extent change over time from [ESRI](https://arcg.is/1C9zba).

The data were all pulled into [ArcGIS Online](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview) from their hosted URL, with the interactivity built from the provided interface tools, including the time slider for ice sheet extent.
