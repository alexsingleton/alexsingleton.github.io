# Day 13: A New Tool

This paper was written when I was feeling quite ill in 2009 as I had caught [Swine Flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom). I am not particularly good at resting when ill and was quite bored. I have a distinct memory of laying flat on my sofa with a tiny sony laptop balanced on my chest and learning to use [ESRI Network Analyst](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-network-analyst/overview); the outcome of which was this paper! This was the first bit of network analysis that I had done, and the first time using this tool. Here is a map of a safety weighted cycling route through London.
