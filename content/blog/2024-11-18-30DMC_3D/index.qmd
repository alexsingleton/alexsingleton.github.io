# Day 18: 3D

Another category of map that I rarely create is 3D. That said, in ESRI ArcGIS Online it was fairly easy to create a 3D map of the 2021 London Output Area Classification. In this a set of Output Areas where the non populated built up areas had been extracted was used as a basemap over extruded building polygons. This is a reasonably close replication of the style that we use in [mapmaker.cdrc.ac.uk](https://mapmaker.cdrc.ac.uk/#/london-oac). This was featured a [couple of days ago](https://www.alex-singleton.com/content/blog/2024-11-16-30DMC_Choropleth/).
