# 30 Day Map Challenge

Last year I had a go at generating quite a few of the [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) images using [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion). Some of these were more successful than others, and a year on, Generative AI has come on leaps and bounds. Some of last years "maps" (really cheats!):

However, for this year I have decided to take on a slightly different approach by hunting through maps and analysis that I have published previously and if I get time, infilling the gaps with some R maps in between! I suspect that I am going to get distracted, but this is my intention at least.
