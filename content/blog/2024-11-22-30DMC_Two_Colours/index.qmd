# Day 22: 2 Colours

For today's challenge, I decided to create a simple plot using some political data from the 2024 UK Election. Labour won overall with a large majority of seats, however, Reform UK, despite not winning many seats also performed far more strongly that many predicted. In this map, we look at second place votes within Labour majority areas.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)
library(magrittr)
library(patchwork)
library(readxl)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
wpc_sf <- st_read("https://services1.arcgis.com/ESMARspQHYMw9BZ9/arcgis/rest/services/Westminster_Parliamentary_Constituencies_July_2024_Boundaries_UK_BGC/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson")
```

The election data are download from [here](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10009/) and read into R.

```{r}
# Read Election Data and fix column names
ed <- read_csv("HoC-GE2024-results-by-constituency.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
wpc_sf %<>%
  left_join(ed, by = c("PCON24CD" = "ons_id"))
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
UK_SF <- st_read("https://services1.arcgis.com/ESMARspQHYMw9BZ9/arcgis/rest/services/Local_Authority_Districts_May_2024_Boundaries_UK_BGC/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson")

R_SF <- st_read("https://services1.arcgis.com/ESMARspQHYMw9BZ9/arcgis/rest/services/Regions_December_2023_Boundaries_EN_BGC/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson")

W_SF <- st_read("https://services1.arcgis.com/ESMARspQHYMw9BZ9/arcgis/rest/services/Countries_December_2023_Boundaries_UK_BGC/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&outSR=27700&f=json") %>%
  filter(CTRY23NM == "Wales")
```

```{r}
# Convert to point
wpc_points_sf <- wpc_sf %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>% # Drop existing geometry
  st_as_sf(coords = c("BNG_E", "BNG_N"), crs = 27700) %>% # Convert to point SF with British National Grid (EPSG:27700)
  select(PCON24CD, PCON24NM, first_party, second_party, lab, ruk,majority) # Keep only the desired columns

```

Next we will subset those parliamentary constituencies where Labour won, but Reform took second place.

```{r}
wpc_points_sf <- wpc_points_sf %>%
  filter(first_party == "Lab")

wpc_points_RUK_sf <- wpc_points_sf %>%
  filter(first_party == "Lab" & second_party == "RUK")
```

```{r}

all <- ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = UK_SF,color = NA, fill = "#1d3557" ) +
  geom_sf(data = wpc_points_sf, color = "#e63946", aes(size = 1)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0, 1))  + 
   coord_sf(crs = st_crs(27700)) +
  theme_minimal() +
   theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.spacing = unit(0, "mm"),
    plot.margin = unit(rep(0, 4), "mm"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', colour = 'white'),
    legend.position = "none"
  ) +  ggtitle('All Labour Wins')

RUK <- ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = UK_SF,color = NA, fill="#1d3557") +
  geom_sf(data = wpc_points_RUK_sf, color = "#e63946", aes(size = 1)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0, 1))  + 
   coord_sf(crs = st_crs(27700)) +
  theme_minimal() +
   theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.spacing = unit(0, "mm"),
    plot.margin = unit(rep(0, 4), "mm"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', colour = 'white'),
    legend.position = "none"
  ) +  ggtitle('Labour Wins Where Reform UK\nCame in Second Place')

all + RUK

```

For those constituency that are in England, we can also a look at these patterns relative to the [Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7327/). First we read in these data and append the IMD values to the election outcomes. We then code a new variable that indicates where Labour won, and where Labour won, but Reform UK came second.

```{r warning=FALSE}

# Read IMD data

IMD <- read_excel("Deprivation-in-English-constituencies.xlsx", skip = 5) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  clean_names()

# Subset to only England WPC and join IMD
wpc_points_sf %<>%
   filter(startsWith(PCON24CD, "E")) %>%
  left_join(IMD, by = c("PCON24CD" = "constituency_code")) 

# Create map variable
wpc_points_sf %<>%
  mutate(LAB_RUK = ifelse(first_party == "Lab" & second_party == "RUK", TRUE, FALSE))


```

We can then plot these as a bar chart. The X axis has a bar for each constituency, ordered by their ranked deprived (Y axis). A low score is the most deprived. The dotted line represents the most deprived quintile of the IMD and there is quite an interesting correspondence of where reform have done well in Labour majority areas.

```{r}

# Create the bar plot with ordering
ggplot(wpc_points_sf, aes(x = fct_reorder(PCON24NM, index_of_multiple_deprivation), 
                          y = index_of_multiple_deprivation, fill = LAB_RUK)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 1) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "#e63946", "FALSE" = "#1d3557")) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 109, color = "#e63946", linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5) +
  labs(
    x = "Constituency",
    y = "Index of Multiple Deprivation",
    title = "Index of Multiple Deprivation by Constituency",
    fill = "LAB_RUK"
  ) +
theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', colour = 'white'),
    legend.position = "none"
  )

```
