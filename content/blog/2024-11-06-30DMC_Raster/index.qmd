# Day 6: Raster

This map exploits advances in machine learning to implement a new method of capturing a measure of urban context from multispectral satellite imagery at a very small area level through the application of a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Cluster analysis was used to generate a typology from the CAE output comprising seven groups describing salient patterns of differentiated urban context. You can view an [interactive map](https://mapmaker.cdrc.ac.uk/#/postcode-context-classification) here, and [download the data](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/postcode-context-classification) too.
